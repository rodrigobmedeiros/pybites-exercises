<p>In the previous Bites, you have successfully transformed an existing script into a CLI using <code>typer.run()</code>.</p>
<p>In this Bite, you will create a CLI application including more than one command to run, leveraging <code>app = typer.Typer()</code>. See the <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/commands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commands documentation</a> for reference.</p>
<p>So, create a command <code>sum</code> that sums two numbers and a command <code>compare</code> that compares two numbers:</p>
<pre>$ python script.py sum 3 5<br />The sum is 8<br /><br />$ python script.py compare 3 5<br />d=5 is greater than c=3</pre>
<p>Check out the tests for more information on how to format the output.</p>
