<p>Write a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">context manager</a> to roll back a transaction on the given <code>Account</code> class.</p>
<p>There are two <em>special (aka <em>dunder</em>) methods</em> you need to define to create a context manager (there is also a convenient decorator - see <a href="../../../../../bites/88/">Bite 88</a>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the context manager is to roll back any transaction that will make the balance go below 0 (debt != cool). The rest of the class is already defined so you can focus on the context manager part.</p>
<p>See the tests for more detail. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
