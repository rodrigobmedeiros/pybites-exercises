<p>In this Bite you are presented with a function that copies the given items data structure.</p>
<p>There is a problem though, the tests fail. <em>Can you fix it? </em></p>
<p>This can be done in a one liner. If you know which module to use it will be easy, if not you will learn something new today.</p>
<p>Regardless we want you to think about Python's <strong>mutability</strong>. Have fun!</p>
