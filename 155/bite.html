<p>Another text manipulation Bite. Code <code>split_words_and_quoted_text</code> that takes a text string and splits it by space, except words that are wrapped between double quotes ("), these spaces needs to be preserved.</p>
<p>So passing it <em>Should give "3 words only"</em>, it would return a list of 3 (not 5) elements: <em>['Should', 'give', '3 words only']</em> (note that the double quotes are stripped off as well).</p>
<p>Check out the standard library, there might be a tool for the job ;) - good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
