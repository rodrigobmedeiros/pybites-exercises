    Args:
        f (Callable): An arbitrary probability density function
            that is used to calculate the acceptance ratio alpha=f(x_next)/f(x_t).
            f has to accept a single parameter x and return the function value for x.
        x_0 (float, optional): The first observation to start from.
        n_samples (int, optional): Number of samples to be drawn. Defaults to 10000.

    Returns:
        (np.ndarray): Drawn samples from the target distribution.
