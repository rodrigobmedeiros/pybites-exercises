<p>As you <a href="../../../../../news">might have noticed</a> we are now on Python 3.7 so time for a Bite on <em>data classes</em> which were introduced with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEP 557</a>.</p>
<p>What are they? Raymond Hettinger summarized it nicely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TwcmT6Rcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his great talk</a>: <em>a mutible named tuple with defaults</em>.</p>
<p>One advantage is the code it saves you typing so they might become an essential part of your Python toolkit!</p>
<p>In this Bite we have you write a data class called <code>Bite</code> that managed 3 attributes: <em>number</em>, <em>title</em>, and <em>level</em>. Their types are <code>int</code>, <code>str</code> and <code>str</code> respectively.</p>
<p>There are 3 more requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>title</em> needs to be capitalized upon instantiation (you get a hint in the tests for this one :) - make sure to read the tests for additonal specs, including some of the differences between <code>data class</code>es and <code>namedtuple</code>s!)</li>
<li><em>level</em> takes a default argument of <em>Beginner</em>.</li>
<li>A collection of Bite instances needs to be orderable (using <code>sort</code> / <code>sorted</code> - this is not by default but configurable ...)</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck and keep up with the language, exciting new things are getting added!<br />On that note feel free to make us more Bite requests via our <a href="../../../../../bites/">Bites homepage</a> (you'll find a form per Bite level at the bottom of the page ...)</p>
<p>For more resources on <em>data classes</em> we recommned watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TwcmT6Rcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hettinger's talk</a> as well as reading through Anthony Shaw's <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-tour-of-python-3-7-data-classes-22ee5e046517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A brief tour of Python 3.7 data classes</a>. Have fun!</p>
