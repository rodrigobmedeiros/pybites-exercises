<p>In this Bite you complete a function that takes an <code>int</code> and returns it appended with the right suffix: 1 -&gt; 1st, 2 -&gt; 2nd, 4 -&gt; 4th, 11 -&gt; 11th, etc.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#Other_suffixes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>-st is used with numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 1st, pronounced first)</li>
<li>-nd is used with numbers ending in 2 (e.g. 92nd, pronounced ninety-second)</li>
<li>-rd is used with numbers ending in 3 (e.g. 33rd, pronounced thirty-third). As an exception to the above rules, all the "teen" numbers ending with 11, 12 or 13 use -th (e.g. 11th, pronounced eleventh, 112th, pronounced one hundred [and] twelfth)</li>
<li>-th is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced ninth).</li>
</ul>
<p>To focus on the exercise you can assume that the number inputted into the function is a positive <code>int</code>. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
