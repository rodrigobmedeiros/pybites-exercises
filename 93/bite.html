<p>Generators are cool right?! Did you know you can send values into a generator by calling its send(value) method? Crazy right?</p>
<p>Let's do a little experiment: complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rock-paper-scissors</a> below, where <code>player_choice</code> receives the next value via <code>send</code>, if <em>q</em> is entered raise a <code>StopIteration</code>.</p>
<p>So the game would work something like this (see all scenarios in the tests):</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from rps import game
&gt;&gt;&gt; game = game()
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(game)
Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors
&gt;&gt;&gt; game.send('rock')
paper beats rock, you lose!
&gt;&gt;&gt; game.send('paper')
paper beats rock, you win!
&gt;&gt;&gt; game.send('rock')
tie!
&gt;&gt;&gt; game.send('q')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
StopIteration

<p>Pretty cool no? As this is an Advanced Bite we're not giving too much away. Good luck, have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
