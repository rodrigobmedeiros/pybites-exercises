<p>This Bite focusses on the use of <code>itertools</code>. To that extend you complete <code>get_possible_dict_words</code> and <code>_get_permutations_draw</code> to get all valid dictionary words for a random draw of 7 letters.</p>
<p>This is fed into the tests that calculate the word with maximum value (work previously done for <a href="../../../../../bites/3/">Bite 3</a>) and there you go: you have a Scrabble cheat tool (Scrabble fans, pay attention or maybe skip this Bite!).</p>
<p>For example a draw of letters <em>G, A, R, Y, T, E, V</em> would give highest valued word <em>GARVEY</em> (13 points).</p>
