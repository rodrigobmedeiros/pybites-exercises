<p>In this Bite you are going to write a 15-way Rock Paper Scissors game (this challenge first appeared as part of our <a href="https://talkpython.fm/100days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 Days of Code in Python course</a>).</p>

<p>The way you read this graphic is if an arrow points from one item to another, that pointed-to item is defeated. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper defeats rock (paper points to rock)</li>
<li>Devil defeats human (devil points to human)</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out to be error prone and generally very unfun to work this out from the graphic. So we created a <code>csv</code> score sheet representing these relationships.</p>
<p>Complete the <code>get_winner</code> function following the docstring. We recommend parsing it into a dictionary/mapping of <em>players -&gt; beats whom</em> (key, value) pairs (helper function <code>_create_defeat_mapping</code>). This will make it easier to determine the winner given any pair of (player1, player2) pairs.</p>
<p>The tests (see <em>TESTS</em> tab) will verify valid input to <code>get_winner</code>, all <em>Tie</em> scenarios and (more interestingly) all 105 outcomes using the original <em><a href="http://www.umop.com/rps15.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPS-15 speak</a></em>.</p>
<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
