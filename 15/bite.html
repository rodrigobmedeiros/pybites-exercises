<p>Iterate over the given <code>names</code> and <code>countries</code> <code>list</code>s, <strong>printing</strong> them prepending the number of the loop (starting at 1). Here is the output you need to deliver:</p>
<pre>1. Julian     Australia
2. Bob        Spain
3. PyBites    Global
4. Dante      Argentina
5. Martin     USA
6. Rodolfo    Mexico
</pre>
<p>Notice that the 2nd column should have a fixed width of 11 chars, so between <em>Julian</em> and <em>Australia</em> there are 5 spaces, between <em>Bob</em> and <em>Spain</em>, there are 8. This column should also be aligned to the left.</p>
<p>Ideally you use only one for loop, but that is not a requirement. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this built-in</a> :)</p>
<p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
