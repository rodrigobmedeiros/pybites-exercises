<p>In this Bite you will swap case all <em>pybites</em> characters (both lower- and upper case) for a given text.</p>
<p>Not much more as for our instruction, just complete <code>convert_pybites_chars</code> which should work like this:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from convert_chars import convert_pybites_chars
&gt;&gt;&gt; text = "Today we added TWO NEW Bites to our Platform, exciting!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; convert_pybites_chars(text)
'todaY wE addEd tWO NeW bITES To our plaTform, ExcITIng!'
</pre>
<p>(Note that all converted chars are in the string <em>pybites</em>)</p>
<p>Have fun and code more Python!</p>
