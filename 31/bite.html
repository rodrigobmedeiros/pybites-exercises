<p>Since 3.5 Python has a binary operator to be used for matrix multiplication: <code>@</code>, see <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEP 465 -- A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>@ sign</em> can now be used on types implementing the <code>__matmul__</code> <em>special/magic/dunder</em> method.</p>
<p>It is important to note that whilst this feature shipped in 3.5, none of the standard library builtin types have matrix multiplication implementations. So let's try to implement it on a custom type for this Bite.</p>
<p>Implement a simple class called <code>Matrix</code> that takes a list of lists in its constructor.</p>
<p>Implement the <code>__matmul__</code>, <code>__rmatmul__</code> (reversed) and <code>__imatmul__</code> (in place) <em>dunder</em> methods.</p>
<p><em>Yes, using <code>numpy</code> a <code>np.dot(self, other)</code> would suffice, but the point is to get you thinking about implementing @ yourself!</em></p>
<p>Here is a how matrix multiplication works:</p>
<pre>A = [[1, 2],  [3, 4]]
B = [[11, 12], [13, 14]]
</pre>
<p>Doing A @ B would do the following multiplications:</p>
<pre>[[1 * 11 + 2 * 13,   1 * 12 + 2 * 14],
[3 * 11 + 4 * 13,   3 * 12 + 4 * 14]]
</pre>
<p>See the tests for more info. Good luck!</p>
