<p>In the previous Bite you have created your first simple Typer application with several commands.</p>
<p>You might have asked yourself, "How do I create arguments or options that are initialized once and can be used by several commands?". Without a feature like that, one could potentially have lots of redundant code that initializes the same arguments and options for multiple commands.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/commands/callback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typer Callback</a> serves exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>In this Bite, you will implement a simple Typer Callback, to get familiar with the concept.</p>
<p>Let's add a verbosity option such that the commands can return a less verbose output by default.</p>
<p>Check out the tests for more information about what output is expected.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
